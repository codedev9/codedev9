# About me
roblox player and developer, and javascript programmer. I've been learning coding since 2021, I am working on a web server and a discord bot currently, both are private for
personal reasons. I am maybe a self taught. All though i watched multiple videos on developing back when i was learning the basics of roblox lua. I am currently the head developer for the game
called Alley Brawl. Which might release, not much progress is being made to it.
